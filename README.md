Macrophone
======

After asking you for a song, Macrophone fetches lyrics from [MetroLyrics](http://www.metrylyrics.com) and reads it them in a voice of your choosing.

When prompted to select a song, artist, or voice, enter your choice followed by the "Enter" key. Don't worry about capitalizationâ€”your input will be processed and formatted automatically. Note that some song names might be formatted in an odd way on the MetroLyrics site; if your selection doesn't work after a few tries, try checking their [website](http://www.metrylyrics.com) to see how they've listed the song.

Your most recent selections are saved in `/tmp/.sing_config`. For example, simply hitting "Enter" after each of the following lines:

	Enter song [wrecking-ball]: 
	Enter artist [miley-cyrus]: 
	Enter voice (type help for a list of voices) [Alex]:
	
will tell your computer to use those settings. You should see:

	Now singing wrecking-ball by miley-cyrus in the voice of Alex (hit ctrl+c to cancel)...
